              My Story
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              I know what it's like to not have a game plan for your money.
              Imagine running around like a chicken with your head cut off (as
              my mama used to say).
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              That was me. I was running around aimlessly. I was in the game,
              but without a plan of how to actually win.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              But that all changed shortly after I had my first son. I started
              devouring finance blogs, books, and articles. I read page after
              page - building my knowledge and slowly creating and implementing
              a plan for our family's money.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              My husband and I worked together to create systems and processes.
              It took years to make some things happen, but it doesn't have to
              take years for you.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              Our stories may not be the same, but there's one thing I know we
              have in common.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              We both want to spend worry-free.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
              We want to feel financially set and secure. You want the best for
              yourself, and you want to partner with someone who has your best
              interests in mind.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-900">
