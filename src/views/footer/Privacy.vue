    <h2>Why We Disclose Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may share Your information with third parties in certain situations. In
      particular, We may share Your data with third-party processors as needed
      to serve Our legitimate business interests, which include administration
      of Our website, administration of Your account, entering into contracts
      with You, communicating with You, taking orders for goods or services,
      delivering Our goods and services, identifying trends, protecting the
      security of Our company and website, and marketing additional goods and
      services to You. The legal basis for Our disclosure of Your data is both
      Your Consent to this Privacy Policy and Our own right to protect and
      promote Our legitimate business interests.
    </p>
    <p>The following are specific reasons why We may share Your information:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Third Party Processing:</strong> We may disclose Your information
      to third parties who assist Us with various tasks, including payment
      processing, hosting services, email delivery, communications, and customer
      service. We may not always disclose these third-party processors if not
      required by law. We do not authorize them to use or disclose Your personal
      information except in connection with providing Our company with their
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>By Law:</strong> We may share Your data as required by law or to
      respond to legal process, including a subpoena, or as necessary to protect
      the rights, property, and safety of others. This includes sharing
      information with other parties to prevent or address fraud and to avoid
      credit risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>To Protect Our Company:</strong> We may use Your information to
      protect Our company, including to investigate and remedy any violations of
      Our rights or policies. We may also disclose Your information as
      reasonably necessary to acquire and maintain insurance coverage, manage
      risks, obtain financial or legal advice, or to exercise or defend against
      legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event Our company
      engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceedings, dissolution,
      reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding, We may transfer or
      share Your data as part of that proceeding. In such transitions, customer
      information is one of the business assets that is acquired by a third
      party. You acknowledge that such business transfers may occur and that
      Your personal information can continue to be stored, used, or processed as
      otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> We may share information with
      advertisers, Our investors, or other third parties for the purpose of
      conducting general business analysis. If We do so, We will make reasonable
      efforts to inform You if required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interaction With Others:</strong> If You interact with others on
      Our website or mobile app, such as participating in a group chat or a
      group online course, other users may have access to some of Your data,
      including Your name, profile picture, and Your history of interaction with
      Our website, such as prior comments or posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Online Postings:</strong> When You post online, Your posts may be
      viewed by others, and We may distribute Your comments outside the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>External Links:</strong> Our website may include hyperlinks to
      other websites not controlled by Us. We suggest You exercise caution when
      clicking on a hyperlink. Although We use reasonable care in including a
      hyperlink on Our own web page, We do not regularly monitor the websites of
      these third parties and are not responsible for any damage or consequences
      You suffer by using these hyperlinks. We are not bound by the Privacy
      Policies of any third-party website that You access by a hyperlink, nor
      are they bound by ours. We encourage You to read the Policies of those
      third-party websites before interacting with them or making purchases.
      They may collect different information and by different methods than We
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Purposes:</strong> We may disclose Your personal data as
      necessary to comply with any legal obligation or to protect Your
      interests, or the vital interests of others or Our company.

      analyze visitors' use of Our website or mobile app to determine the
      popularity of the content, and better understand online activity. We do
      not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors. However,
      in order to access Our website, You must consent to the collection and use
      of Your information by these third-party analytic companies. You should

    <h2>Processing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      For the most part, We do not process Your information in-house, but give
      it to third-party processors for processing. For example, when PayPal
      takes Your payment information, they are a third-party processor. They
      process Your payment and remit the funds to Us. So in many instances, it
      will be necessary for Us to transmit Your information to a third-party
      processor, as We do not have the capability to perform these functions.

      You with goods and services, to comply with Our legal obligations, to
      obtain professional advice, and to protect the rights and interests of Our
      company, Our customers (including You), and any third parties. We may
      process the following data:

      or misuse. We cannot guarantee complete security of any information You
      transmit to Us.

    <p>
      We will notify You promptly of any known breach of Our security systems or
      Your data which might expose You to serious risk.
