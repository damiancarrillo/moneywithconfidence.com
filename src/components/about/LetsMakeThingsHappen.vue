                I know what it&rsquo;s like to not have a game plan for your
                money. Imagine running around like a chicken with your head cut
                off (as my mama used to say). That&rsquo;s what it can feel like
                when you don&rsquo;t have a plan.

                That was me. I was running around aimlessly. I was in the game,
                but without a plan of how to actually win. But that all changed
                shortly after I had my first son. I started devouring finance
                blogs, books, and articles. I read page after page and started
                building my knowledge and slowly creating and implementing a
                plan for our family&rsquo;s money. My husband and I worked
                together to create systems and processes. It took years to make
                some things happen, but
                <span class="font-semibold"
                  >it doesn&rsquo;t have to take years for you</span
                >.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-8">
                Our stories may not be the same but there&rsquo;s one thing I
                know we have in common:
                <span class="font-semibold"
                  >we both want to spend worry-free and feel financially set and
                  secure</span
                >. You want the best for yourself, and you want to partner with
                someone who has your best interests in mind.
              </p>
